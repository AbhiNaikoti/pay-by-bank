# Manual Enrollment Architecture
## Explanation of Feature
The consumer has an option to manually key in all information required for ConnectPay enrollment into the enrollment screen.
Usually after a manual enrollment, two micro deposits are made to the consumerâ€™s bank account. The consumer waits for 1-3 business days for these micro deposits to appear in their bank account, following which he/she needs to validate their account by answering micro deposit amount questions via the Micro Deposit Validation process.
The consumer is in a pending validation status and will not be able to transact until the validation is completed.

## Implementation Steps: Manual Enrollment
### Create Session Token 
[Create Session Token](https://qa-developer.fiserv.com/product/ConnectPay/api/?type=post&path=/security/createsessiontoken&branch=develop&version=1.0.0 'Create Session Token')
### Initialize and Launch ConnectPay SDK <LINK>
You will want to go to the specific mobile operating section and look to initialize the App
[WebSDK](https://qa-developer.fiserv.com/product/ConnectPay/docs/?path=documentation/websdk.md&branch=develop 'Web SDK Instructions')
[iOS]([(https://qa-developer.fiserv.com/product/ConnectPay/docs/?path=documentation/iossdk.md&branch=develop)'iOS SDK Instructions')
[Android]((https://qa-developer.fiserv.com/product/ConnectPay/docs/?path=documentation/androidsdk.md&branch=develop)'Android SDK Instructions')

### Further Steps
<ol>
  <li>Pass necessary data to the SDK(including fdCustomerId)</li>
  <li>SDK presents the screens to consumer to capture consumer information</li>
  <li>SDK completes enrollment process and returns NONCE tomerchantApp</li>
  <li>NONCE passed back to merchant server</li>
  <li>Merchant server does a server-to-server GetData call to retrieve fdAccountId generated after consumer data vaulting. Merchant additionally receives the current consumer status as a part of this call</li>
  <li>Merchant server stores the fdCustomerId, fdAccountId (optional) against the externalId in their system for future use</li>
</ol>
